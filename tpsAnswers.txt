TPS Activity 2

1. How do you compile your punishment.c so that you can debug it using GDB (or LLDB for MAC)?
    When compiling you type "gcc -g <name_of_file>" in the terminal to make a executable that is made for debugging.

2. Once punishment.c is compiled, how do you load it in GDB (or LLDB for MAC)? Try it with your
program.
    For MACOS you go to your terminal and type "lldb <name_of_executable>". For WindosOS it is "gdb <name_of_executable>

3. Once punish is loaded, how do you run it in GDB (or LLDB for MAC)?
    To run the executable in GDB or LLDB you type "run" or "r" in the GDB/LLDB terminal

4. What are breakpoints? How do you set a breakpoint at a certain line of your program?
    Breakpoints are checks that tell the debugger to stop at a certain function. To set a breakpoint in GDB/LLDB you type "b <name_of_function>"

5. Now run the program again. It should stop at the breakpoint you set in Q4. From here, how do you run
the program line by line?
    To move to the next line after a breakpoint then you can type "n" in the terminal to move to the next line.

6. While you are still running punish line by line, how can you see the value of a variable? 
    To view a varaible you type "frame variable <name_of_variable>"

7. Now that you are tired of running line by line, how do you let the program finish its run?
    To let the program finish running you type "run" in the terminal.

8. How do you exit from GDB (or LLDB for MAC)?
    To exit from the debugger you type "quit" in the terminal.



TPS Activity 3

1. How many variables were declared in the first line of main()? How many of them are pointers (and
what are they)?
    There are four variables declared. Two of them are pointers that hold a memeory address.

2. What will be the values of x, y, and arr[0] if you run the program? 
    The values of x, y, and arr[0] are going to be garbage values.

3. How do you prevent x, y, and the content of arr from having unexpected values? Try to fix them in
the program.
    To prevent this you can iniziaile the varaibles to something then change them later on in the program.

8. Now print out the address of arr. Does the result make sense? Why?
    Yes, beacuse the arr[0] points to the first memory address of the array and so does arr.
