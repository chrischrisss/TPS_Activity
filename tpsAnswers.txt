    You can use more than one terminal to multitask. For example, each can run an individual program and display different output.

command)?
    To tell the contents inside the current directory you use the command ls

TPS ACTIVITY 3

3. What command do you type in the terminal to compile your main.c?
    If you want to compile main.c you type gcc main.c in the terminal.

4. How do you know if your program has compiled successfully?
    If your program compiled successfully an executable file is created.

5. What does the –c flag do in gcc?
    The -c stops the compiler from linking and creates an object file with the extension .o.

6. What does the –g flag do in gcc?
    The -g tells the compiler to produce debugging information. This is useful when debugging a program.

7. How do you change the executable name from main to cselab1?
    Use the -o command line when compiling and change the name of main to cselab1.

8. What happens when you compile your code by typing gcc main.c only?
    It creates the object files and links to an executable in one line.

9. Now, let us run the program you have just compiled. What command do you use?
    To run the compiled program you type ./a.out in the terminal or ./[NameOfExecutableFile].
